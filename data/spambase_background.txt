Data Set Information:
The "spam" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...

Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam. Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.

For background on spam:

Cranor, Lorrie F., LaMacchia, Brian A. Spam!
Communications of the ACM, 41(8):74-83, 1998.

(a) Hewlett-Packard Internal-only Technical Report. External forthcoming.

(b) Determine whether a given email is spam or not.

(c) ~7% misclassification error. False positives (marking good mail as spam) are very undesirable.If we insist on zero false positives in the training/testing set, 20-25% of the spam passed through the filter.

Attribute Information:
The last column of 'spambase.data' denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail. Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occuring in the e-mail. The run-length attributes (55-57) measure the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters. For the statistical measures of each attribute, see the end of this file. Here are the definitions of the attributes:

48 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type word_freq_WORD
= percentage of words in the e-mail that match WORD, i.e. 100 * (number of times the WORD appears in the e-mail) / total number of words in e-mail. A "word" in this case is any string of alphanumeric characters bounded by non-alphanumeric characters or end-of-string.

6 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type char_freq_CHAR]
= percentage of characters in the e-mail that match CHAR, i.e. 100 * (number of CHAR occurences) / total characters in e-mail

1 continuous real [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_average
= average length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters

1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_longest
= length of longest uninterrupted sequence of capital letters

1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total
= sum of length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters
= total number of capital letters in the e-mail

1 nominal {0,1} class attribute of type spam= denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail.
